Mac: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac
Windows: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows

2. While waiting for Node.js and npm to install, come up with a great team name. Not too long, not too short. Just a perfect team name.
3. Open the project using your favorite JavaScript source code editor.
4. Open the file `bot.js` and enter your team name.
5. Discuss the perfect game plan for bets and actions.
6. Type your logic in the two functions specfifed in the `bot.js` file called `bet` and `action`. Don't forget to read the documentation.
7. When you are ready to test your implementation, navigate to the `as-shackjack-client` folder and call `make test`. This will initialize a local game server. To start the game, open your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/start_game and click the button. Now you can inspect your terminal to see how your bot behaves.
8. When your bot is ready to compete against the other bots, open up `as-shackjack-client/config.js` and change url to the out commented one.

## Rules

A game of Shackjack is just as a normal game of Blackjack, but with a reduced action set. Players can only do a **hit**, **stand** or **double** when it's their turn. If **you** don't know the rules of Blackjack, Google does.
